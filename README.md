## Long Description:
JavaScript Library is a simple web application that allows users to create and track books. It includes a form for creating book entries, with attributes of title, author, number of pages, and a checkbox for marking the book as read or not read. The app displays a list of all the books that have been added, along with their corresponding attributes.

The app is built with vanilla JavaScript and utilizes an object to store book information. It is styled using Bulma CSS and is responsive. The app includes a form for adding new books and buttons for deleting books and marking them as read. The book list is displayed using plain HTML. The book information is only stored for the current session and is not persisted beyond the current page refresh.

Also includes Documentation and About pages.
